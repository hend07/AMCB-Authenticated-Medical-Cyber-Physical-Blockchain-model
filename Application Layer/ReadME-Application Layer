# AMCB – Authenticated Medical Cyber-Physical Blockchain Model

🔬 This code contains the **extended implementation** developed as part of my **MSc Research Project (2025)** titled:

> **"AMCB: Authenticated Medical Cyber-Physical Blockchain Model"**

This work builds upon the original blockchain medical record system and enhances it by integrating **Firebase-based secure cloud storage**, **authenticated cyber-physical validation**, and an **intelligent trust layer** inspired by CPS security architectures.

📌 *Original implementation reference:* `JasonnLim/Blockchain-MedicalRecords`  
📌 *This AMCB-enhanced version introduces secure Firebase synchronization and a validated access workflow.*

## ✅ Enhancements Introduced in the AMCB Version

The AMCB release extends the original project with the following capabilities:

- 🔐 **Cloud-based persistent storage using Firebase** to securely store validated medical records beyond on-chain logs.
- 🧠 **Cyber-Physical trust layer** aligned with real-world CPS security requirements.
- 🌐 **Secure synchronization logic** between blockchain events and cloud storage.
- 📡 **Improved modular structure**, preparing the system for integration with IoT / CPS edge devices.

## ▶️ Running the AMCB System

### ✅ Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed and configured:

- ✅ **Node.js**
- ✅ **Metamask** browser extension
- ✅ Set Metamask to **Rinkeby or Goerli Test Network**
- ✅ Get test ETH from a **Faucet**
- ✅ Firebase project configured (Firestore / Cloud Storage enabled)

### 📦 Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

---

### 🚀 Start the AMCB DApp
```bash
npm run start
```

---

### 🧪 Run Smart Contract Tests
```bash
npm run test
```

---

### 🔁 Recompile & Deploy Smart Contracts (after editing Solidity code)
