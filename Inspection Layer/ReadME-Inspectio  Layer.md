# 🧩 Inspection Layer – README

## 🎯 Overview
The **Inspection Layer** serves as an internal **AI Forensic Checkpoint** that validates and cross-examines every analytical decision generated by the lower layers. It ensures that only consistent and verified outputs proceed toward blockchain logging or physical execution.

This layer adopts a **"trust-but-verify"** security paradigm—designed to reduce the risk of **false acceptance, model evasion, drift attacks, and adversarial bypass attempts**.

---

## 🔍 Functional Workflow
1. **Input Reception** – The layer receives a flagged record, event, or transaction from the **Fog/Analytical Layer**.
2. **Scenario Selection** – Depending on the input type (network flow, executable file, or APK), the layer dynamically triggers one of the benchmark **ML Test Scenarios**.
3. **Cross-Validation** – The decision is compared between:
   - A **Baseline Model** (static, verified model used as reference)
   - An **Adaptive Model** (dynamically updated through continuous learning)

## 🧪 ML Test Scenarios Integrated into Inspection Layer

| # | Test Scenario Title | Description | Dataset Source | Objective |
|---|---------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | **ML Test Model for IoT Intrusion Detection** | Detects abnormal communication in IoT networks using flow-based features. | PCAP / Flow Datasets | Identify intrusions or spoofed network sessions. |
| 2 | **ML Test Model for Malware Detection for Portable Executable Files** | Analyzes raw PE binaries to extract malicious patterns at binary-level. | PE Raw Binary Dataset | Detect harmful Windows executables before execution. |
| 3 | **ML Test Model for PE Headers Malware Detection** | Performs lightweight malware screening using PE header metadata only. | PE Header / Metadata | Enable ultra-fast pre-execution filtering. |
| 4 | **ML Test Model for Android Malware Detection** | Uses opcode and permission analysis to classify Android APK threats. | APK / DEX Static Features | Secure IoT/Edge Android-based devices from malware. |

## ⚙️ Automatic Scenario Selection Logic
| Input Type | Triggered Scenario |
|------------|-------------------|
| Network Flow / PCAP Data | Scenario 1 |
| Full Windows PE Binary | Scenario 2 |
| Only PE Header Stream (Metadata) | Scenario 3 |
| APK / DEX Android Application | Scenario 4 |

The orchestration logic ensures **modular plug-and-play integration** for future models without restructuring the core pipeline.

## 📎 Source & Attribution Notice (Kaggle Dataset Integration)

Some of the validation pipelines and baseline benchmarks integrated within this layer were partially built or inspired using **public Kaggle datasets**, which were **refactored, restructured, and modularized** to align with the architecture of the Inspection Layer.

| Kaggle Dataset / Project | Applied Scenario | Purpose in Pipeline |
|------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **N-BaIoT Dataset to Detect IoT Botnet Attacks** | Scenario 1 – IoT Intrusion Detection | Model benchmarking for IoT botnet and abnormal traffic detection. |
| **IoT Malware Detection and Classification** | Scenario 1 & Scenario 4 | Cross-domain malware behavior analysis between IoT and Android devices. |
| **Network Traffic Android Malware** | Scenario 4 – Android Malware Detection | Opcode and permission-based classification for Android threats. |
| **pe_header_data – Malware Detection Using ML (PE Files)** | Scenario 3 – PE Header Malware Detection | Lightweight PE metadata-based malware scanning for rapid pre-filtering. |
