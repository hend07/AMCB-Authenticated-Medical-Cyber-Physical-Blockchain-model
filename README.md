# AMCB – Authenticated Medical Cyber-Physical Blockchain Model

This repository hosts the **official research-aligned codebase** for the **AMCB framework**, developed as part of an MSc thesis project and later **published in 2024**.  
The implementation was further extended in **2025** to map the research architecture directly to an executable multi-layer system.

## 🧠 Project Overview

AMCB proposes a **multi-layered security model** for authenticated medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS).  
The framework integrates **PUF-based physical authentication**, **blockchain-anchored identity**, **cloud storage resilience**, and **AI-driven inspection** to form an end-to-end trust chain between medical devices, users, and cloud infrastructure.

This repository provides the **practical mapping** of that model into modular components, each implemented as a standalone layer.

## 🧭 AMCB Layer Architecture (Research → Implementation)

| **Layer** | **Repository Folder** | **Conceptual Function** | **Implementation Description** |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 🧩 **Physical Layer** | `/physical-layer/` | Establishes hardware-rooted trust using PUFs | Implements a real logic-based PUF circuit producing 5 hardware keys verified via MAC + PUF pairing before blockchain registration |
| ⛓ **Blockchain Layer** | `/blockchain-layer/ethereum/` | Provides decentralized identity ledger | Solidity smart contract for secure on-chain registration of verified entities |
| ☁ **Storage Layer** | `/storage-layer/firebase/` | Ensures redundant data persistence | Firebase integration for off-chain encrypted record storage and synchronization |
| 🔍 **Inspection Layer** | `/inspection-layer/` | Performs AI/ML-based integrity validation | Includes five datasets and ML models evaluated to reproduce the paper’s experimental results |
| 💻 **Application Layer** | `/application-layer/` | User & access-control interface | DApp built with React / Next.js connecting blockchain events to Firebase storage |
| 🧪 **Deployment & Testing** | `/tests/` | Verifies functional integrity | Mocha / Chai scripts for smart-contract unit testing |
