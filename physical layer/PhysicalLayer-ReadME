# 🔐 Physical Layer — PUF-Based Device Identity (Root of Trust in AMCB)

### 🎓 Role in AMCB Architecture
This layer represents the **Root of Trust (Physical Authentication Stage)** described in the AMCB model.  
Instead of assuming abstract device identity, **a real PUF logic circuit was designed to generate 5 unique hardware response keys**.

### 🧩 Stage 1 — PUF Circuit Identity Generation
- A **hardware-inspired logic circuit (PUF)** was manually constructed.
- **5 device-specific PUF responses** were extracted from it.
- These represent **real CPS fingerprint identities**, not randomly generated keys.

### 🧪 Stage 2 — MAC + PUF Verification Script (Pre-Blockchain Access Gate)
Before allowing devices to be written into the blockchain, **a verification script was executed** to ensure **only trusted CPS hardware identities are registered**.

👉 Script used: (physical layer/MAC Adresse And PUF Verification.js)

```

> ✅ **Only devices that passed this physical verification were allowed to register into the Blockchain Layer**, matching the **AMCB pre-authentication rule**.

### 📌 Output of This Layer
| Device | MAC Address | PUF Response (Extracted Key) | Status |
|--------|------------|-----------------------------|--------|
| Device 1 | ... | ... | ✅ Accepted |
| Device 2 | ... | ... | ✅ Accepted |
| ... | ... | ... | ✅ Accepted |

> 🎯 **This completes Layer 1 (Physical Trust Initialization).** Output keys from this layer are forwarded next to the Blockchain Layer for ledger registration.
